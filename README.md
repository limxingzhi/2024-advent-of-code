Day 01 :
- part 1 : simple reduce functions
- part 2 : simple reduce functions + table

Day 02:
- part 1 : simple filter / reduce function based on rules
- part 2 : once assume every single report has an error, then there is only one case to handle.
    - splicing every item in the array and testing against the rules (i.e. always engage the damper)
    - O(n^2) solution
